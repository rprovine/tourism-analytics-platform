# 🚂 Railway Deployment Fix

> **Service Unavailable Error? Here's the fix!**

## 🔧 **Common Railway Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: "Service Unavailable" / Retrying for 4m55s**

**Causes:**
1. Database not ready when app starts
2. Missing environment variables
3. Port binding issues
4. Migration failures

**✅ I've Fixed These Issues:**
- Added database connection waiting
- Improved startup script with error handling
- Better port configuration
- Graceful migration handling

## 🚀 **Updated Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Redeploy with Fixes**
1. **Go to your Railway project**
2. **Click "Redeploy"** or **trigger new deployment**
3. **New fixes will automatically apply**

### **Step 2: Check Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set in Railway:
```
SECRET_KEY = your-32-character-secret-key
DEBUG = false
PROJECT_NAME = Tourism Analytics Platform - KoinTyme
```

**Generate SECRET_KEY:**
```python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
```

### **Step 3: Check Database Setup**
Ensure you have:
- ✅ **PostgreSQL database** added to project
- ✅ **Redis database** added to project
- ✅ **Both connected** to your app service

### **Step 4: Monitor Deployment**
1. **Go to deployments tab**
2. **Click on latest deployment**
3. **Watch the logs** for:
   ```
   🌺 Starting Tourism Analytics Platform...
   🚀 Engineered by KoinTyme
   Waiting for database...
   Database connected!
   Running database migrations...
   Starting FastAPI server...
   ```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Still Failing:**

1. **Check Logs:**
   - Go to your service in Railway
   - Click "View Logs"
   - Look for specific error messages

2. **Common Fixes:**
   - **Database Issues**: Wait 30 seconds after creating databases, then redeploy
   - **Port Issues**: Railway automatically sets PORT, should work now
   - **Memory Issues**: Upgrade to higher plan if needed

3. **Manual Restart:**
   - Click "Restart" in Railway dashboard
   - Sometimes fixes connectivity issues

### **Alternative: Deploy Without Database Initially**
1. **Remove database connections** temporarily
2. **Deploy successfully**  
3. **Add databases**
4. **Redeploy**

## 🎯 **Expected Success Logs**
```

## 📞 **Still Having Issues?**

If Railway continues to fail:

1. **Try Render.com**: Similar to Railway, often more reliable
2. **Use DigitalOcean**: Manual setup but guaranteed to work
3. **Contact me**: The deployment should work with these fixes
