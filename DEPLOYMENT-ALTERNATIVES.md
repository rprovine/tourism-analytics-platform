# 🚀 Deployment Alternatives - DigitalOcean Memory Issues

DigitalOcean App Platform has build memory limitations that make it difficult to deploy ML-heavy applications.

## 🎯 **Recommended Alternatives**

### **Option 1: Railway (Your Paid Subscription)**
- **Memory**: 8GB build, 512MB-8GB runtime
- **Cost**: Your existing subscription
- **Setup**: Already configured in the repo
- **Command**: Use the fixed railway.json

### **Option 2: Render.com**
- **Memory**: 7GB build, 512MB+ runtime  
- **Cost**: $7/month for basic plan
- **Setup**: Use existing requirements-lite.txt
- **Better for**: ML applications

### **Option 3: Heroku**
- **Memory**: 2.5GB build, 512MB runtime
- **Cost**: $5-7/month  
- **Setup**: Simple git push deployment
- **Good for**: Most applications

### **Option 4: DigitalOcean Droplet (VPS)**
- **Memory**: 1GB-8GB+, you control everything
- **Cost**: $4-40/month based on size
- **Setup**: Manual but unlimited control
- **Best for**: Custom deployments

## 🛠️ **Quick Railway Deployment**

Since you already have Railway Pro:

1. **Go to Railway** → **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub**
2. **Select**: `rprovine/tourism-analytics-platform`
3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   USE_DEMO_DATA=true
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```
4. **Deploy** - Railway handles everything automatically

## 📊 **Memory Requirements by Platform**

| Platform | Build Memory | Runtime Memory | ML Support |
|----------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| DigitalOcean | 1-2GB | 512MB-4GB | ❌ Limited |
| Railway | 8GB | 512MB-8GB | ✅ Excellent |
| Render | 7GB | 512MB+ | ✅ Good |
| Heroku | 2.5GB | 512MB | ⚠️ Basic |
| VPS/Droplet | Unlimited | Unlimited | ✅ Full Control |

## 🎯 **My Recommendation**

**Use Railway** - you already have the subscription and it's designed for this type of application. The tourism platform should deploy successfully there with all features intact.
